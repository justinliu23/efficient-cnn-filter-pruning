# efficient-cnn-filter-pruning

This repository demonstrates filter pruning for CNNs. Filter pruning was used to remove less important filters from the convolutional layers, thereby reducing the model size and improving inference speed without significantly affecting performance.

The project was developed as part of Harvard's graduate CS 2420 course (Computing at Scale, Fall 2024).
